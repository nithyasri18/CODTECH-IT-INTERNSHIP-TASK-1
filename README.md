Name:NITHYA SRI S
Company:CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS
INTERN ID:CT4PP2825
Domain:PYTHON PROGRAMMING 
Duration:JUNE to JULY 2024 
Mentor:Neela Santhosh Kumar

Overview of the project:
User Profiles: The User class represents a user with their name, username, profile picture, friends, followers, posts, notifications, and privacy settings.
Friend Connections: Users can send and accept friend requests, and maintain a list of their friends.
Messaging: The program does not include a direct messaging feature, but notifications can be used to simulate messaging functionality.
Notifications: Users receive notifications for friend requests, new posts from friends, and other activities. 
News Feed: Users can retrieve a news feed of the latest posts from their friends, sorted by timestamp.
Multimedia Sharing: The program does not include multimedia sharing functionality, but it can be extended to support it.
Advanced Functionalities:
Real-time Updates: The program simulates real-time updates by continuously checking for new notifications and displaying them.
Content Recommendations: The program simulates content recommendations by randomly selecting a post from the user's feed and displaying it.
Privacy Settings: Users can set privacy settings for their profile and posts.
Technical Approach:
The social networking site will be developed using Python as the primary programming language. The project will leverage various Python libraries and frameworks to implement the necessary functionality, such as:
Flask or Django for the web application framework
SQLAlchemy or PyMongo for database management
WebSockets or Socket.IO for real-time updates
Machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow) for content recommendations
The project will also incorporate best practices in software engineering, such as modular design, object-oriented programming, and test-driven development to ensure maintainability and scalability.
Target Audience:
The ConnectHub social networking site is designed to serve a wide range of users, from individuals looking to connect with friends and share their experiences to communities and organizations seeking to build and engage their audience.
Expected Outcomes:
By the end of the project, the ConnectHub social networking site will provide users with a comprehensive and engaging platform for social interactions, content sharing, and community building. The advanced functionalities, such as real-time updates and content recommendations, will enhance the user experience and foster stronger connections among the platform's user base.
